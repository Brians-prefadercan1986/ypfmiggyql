Just walked out of The Ugly Stepsister and woah, my brain feels like spaghetti trying to cling to a wall. Theater was buzzing, like a hive, kinda sticky too — popcorn seeds everywhere, like tasteless little grenades. I think one exploded in my chair. 

The scenes kept flashing, all tangled. That part where she stands there in the shoe store, glass slippers more like glass prisons, twisting her feet into awkward contortions like a flamingo stuck in a muddy puddle. It hit me weird. Made me think of the time I tried fitting a shoe on a manakin foot at work, never fit quite right, like trying to force a puzzle piece into the wrong hole. 

> Oh, and the soundtrack, somehow like seagulls fighting over a slice of pizza — loud and screechy but kinda beautiful in a messy way? Really jarring in moments. Was interesting tho, the tech choice, those digital shimmers that just, like, vibrated in the background during the ball. Felt like my brain was a smartphone on vibrate.

Kinda ironic while being stuck in the dark, I remembered Jenny (or was it Jerry??) asking to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for them. Def do that, but maybe ease on the caffeine first? Makes Cinderella feel like Shakespeare had a dance-off with Tim Burton, but with fewer catchy songs and more, hmm, existential dread? Probably need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to piece the timeline straight. 

Oh, was it deliberate, the way the theater smelled faintly like wet cardboard, adding to the chaos onscreen? Made me feel like I was inside a big cardboard box, painted with neon dreams. My back aches like I was carrying all those oversized dresses myself. 

Find myself wondering if they had a cat in the   or am I just imagining the Duchess yelling at a fur coat. 

Got this visual of clunky shoes being like misunderstood critters—shoes have feelings too (right??). They’re really just like us, shoved into a life path they can’t control, like actors playing a never-ending game of musical chairs with their feet.

Hope that made sense, but ah, I’m still in the post-  daze. Let me know if you figure it out?
